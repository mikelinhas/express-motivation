## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install express-motivation
```

## Example

The `motivation` acts as a small middleware which will append an `X-Motivation` header to each response.

You can also use the `motivationErrorHandler` which will print out a standard `Oh no!` error if there is an `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

```js
const express = require('express')
const { motivation, motivationErrorHandler } = require('express-motivation')

const app = express()

app.use(motivation)
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.send('üçÜ Hello there!')
})
app.get('/error', function (req, res, next) {
    next(new Error("Big Error!"))
})
app.use(motivationErrorHandler)

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('üöÄ Motivation app listening on port 3000')
})
```

The server will now respond as such:

``` haskell
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
X-Motivation: Too many of us are not living our dreams because we are living our fears. - Les Brown

üçÜ Hello there!
```

## Philosophy

We spend a whole lot of time writing, testing, and using RESTful APIs. This plugin helps to motivate you along the way.

If you are stuck trying to fix a bug on one of your endpoints, take a step back, and check what motivational phrase you are getting.

## Contributing

This is my first opensource project so I have no clue how to organize this. It would be cool to add different languages and configurations for this silly (yet fun) project.
